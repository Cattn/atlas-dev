Atlas is a minimalistic proxy service packed with important features for a simple, streamlined proxy experience. It was an entry for the 2024 Titanium Network Proxathon.

## Features

`🖥️ Minimal` Atlas's minimalized UI allows you to browse quickly and easily with the least possible obstructions.

`🔖 Bookmarks` Save the tab you're browsing on to come back to it later.

`🚀 Shortcuts` Quickly launch popular websites instead of searching for them.

`🧩 Customization` Personalize Atlas just the way you like it, with a wide range of different settings to customize.

`🔒 Secure` Browsing with Atlas is secure by default; all your data is end-to-end encrypted while being processed securely and privately.

`💨 Speedy` Made in Astro, Atlas's static composition ensures swift interface navigation and small bundle sizes.

## Maintainers

Atlas is maintained by a group of dedicated developers made up from other proxy services.
