Atlas is minimalistic proxy, yet retains important features for a streamlined proxy experience. It was an entry for the 2024 Titanium Network Proxathon, receiving first place.

## Features

`🖥️ Minimal` Atlas's minimalized UI allows you to browse quickly and easily with the least possible obstructions.

`🔖 Bookmarks` Save pages with the Bookmark button while browsing and come back to it later in the Bookmark page.

`⚙️ Customization` Customize Atlas's settings and behavior to your preference.

`🔒 Secure` Browsing is secure by default; all your data is processed securely and privately.

`💨 Speed` Being created in Astro, Atlas's static composition is as fast as can be without bloat.

## Maintainers

Atlas is maintained by a group of dedicated developers made up from other proxy services.
